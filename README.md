# Food Redistribution Platform - README

## Overview
Our platform is designed to help reduce food wastage by connecting restaurants and other food providers with consumers who need food. By redistributing surplus food from kitchens to seekers such as government colleges, NGOs, and old age homes, we aim to create a sustainable and efficient food-sharing ecosystem.

## Features

### 1. Kitchen Partnership
Kitchens and restaurants can partner with our platform to share their daily leftover food with consumers in need. This helps reduce food wastage and benefits communities facing food insecurity. Additionally, for food safety compliance, all kitchens must provide their FSSAI code during registration.

### 2. Seekers - Food Consumers
Seekers on our platform include government colleges, NGOs, old age homes, and other institutions that can request and receive leftover food from registered kitchens. This system ensures that excess food is put to good use rather than being discarded.

### 3. Real-time Frontend Dashboard
Users can view a dynamic frontend that displays the number of registered kitchens and seekers, along with how they are connected through the platform.

### 4. Interactive Map Integration
Our platform features an interactive map that allows both kitchens and seekers to locate nearby partners. This helps in easy coordination for food redistribution.

### 5. Volunteer System for Food Delivery
We provide a dedicated page where volunteers can sign up to assist in food delivery between kitchens and seekers, ensuring smooth logistics and timely distribution.

### 6. Automated Email Notification System
To streamline communication, we have developed an automated email notification system:
- When a kitchen registers, the admin is notified.
- When a seeker requests food, the kitchens are notified.
- When food is being delivered, delivery personnel receive email notifications to coordinate the process.

### 7. Smart Food Distribution Algorithm
Our platform incorporates a smart algorithm that efficiently distributes surplus food to the nearest and most in-need seeker. The algorithm takes into account multiple factors such as:
- Number of food requests received by a seeker
- Distance between the kitchen and the seeker
- Time taken for delivery

## How It Works
1. **Kitchen Registration:** Kitchens register on the platform and list their daily leftover food. They must also provide their FSSAI code to ensure food safety compliance.
2. **Seeker Registration:** Seekers register and request food as needed.
3. **Matching Algorithm:** The system matches food providers with seekers based on need and proximity.
4. **Volunteer Assignment:** Volunteers help in delivering food between the kitchens and seekers.
5. **Email Notifications:** All stakeholders (kitchens, seekers, delivery personnel) receive real-time email updates for smooth coordination.
6. **Food Delivery & Completion:** The food is successfully delivered, helping reduce waste and support communities in need.
